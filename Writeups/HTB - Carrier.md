## Overview

## Methodology
1. Use `ping`, `tcpdump`, and `wireshark` to figure out why ftp connection is not working

## Learning Points
- Understanding `quagga` commands
	- related to CISCO commands
	- but most importantly understanding BGP and routing terminology helps simplify this because the command has autocomplete
- Need to have good networking theory
	- BGP
	- the part where I had to figure out why the ftp connection wasn't working
