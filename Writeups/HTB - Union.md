## Overview
{description}

## Methodology
1. Step one
2. Step two

## Learning Points
- even if you cant read `/etc/sudoers` or are not in the `sudo` group, remember to always run `sudo -l`  becuase you can still have a config in sudoers that will allow you to run sudo
	- which is literally the case with this box
