- Information gathering is the process of collecting information about a target system or network
	- E.g. OS, system architecture, installed applications, network topolgy
	- Passive or active
- Enumeration is a type of active information gathering involving queries to the target about users, resources, and services

- Fingerprinting
	- Fingerprinting refers to the process of identifying the specific operating system, software, or hardware being used by a target system or network.
	-   Fingerprinting can be accomplished using a variety of techniques, such as network scanning, packet analysis, and vulnerability scanning.
	-   Once a system has been fingerprinted, this information can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors, and to focus subsequent efforts on the most promising attack vectors.
